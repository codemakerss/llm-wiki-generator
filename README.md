# LLM Wiki Generator

A preview-first document ingestion and retrieval workflow for building a structured, local, Obsidian-compatible LLM Wiki.

LLM Wiki Generator turns raw source files into traceable wiki knowledge through an explicit pipeline: `convert -> show-updates -> apply -> index -> answer`.
It is designed for agent workflows, local knowledge systems, and standalone CLI usage where auditability matters more than direct "chat with files" convenience.

## Why This Exists

Most document-driven knowledge workflows break down in one of two ways:

- raw files remain unstructured and difficult to reuse
- LLM-based ingestion writes too much, too early, with too little control

This project takes a stricter path.

Instead of treating source files as a chat substrate, it treats them as inputs to a staged knowledge pipeline:

1. convert source material into normalized text
2. generate proposed wiki updates
3. let the user review those updates
4. write approved knowledge into a vault
5. build a retrieval index over the result

The goal is not just answering questions.
The goal is building a knowledge base that can keep evolving without becoming opaque.

```

## Properties

- Supports `PDF`, `DOCX`, `PPTX`, `XLSX`, and `TXT`
- Uses a preview-before-write archive flow
- Writes into an Obsidian-compatible vault layout
- Keeps raw sources and structured knowledge separate
- Builds a local SQLite retrieval index
- Supports stable and draft knowledge scopes
- Provides bootstrap-style initialization for first-time setup
- Persists chosen vault paths into `.env`

## Quick Start

### Option A: Skill-first workflow

If your host environment supports skill installation:

```bash
npx install skill llm-wiki-generator
```

Check whether the workspace has already been initialized:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py bootstrap-status --as-json
```

If not initialized, create the vault at the chosen path:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py bootstrap-init path/to/wiki-vault
```

Once initialized, continue directly into document ingestion.

### Option B: Manual CLI workflow

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then either inspect bootstrap status:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py bootstrap-status --as-json
```

Or initialize directly if the vault path is already configured:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py init
```

## Example Commands

Convert a file:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py convert path/to/file.pdf
```

Preview archive updates:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py show-updates path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

Apply approved updates:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py apply path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

Build the retrieval index:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py index
```

Query the wiki:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py answer "What business constraints are currently known?"
```

Include draft knowledge:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py answer "What design ideas were mentioned in team history?" --scope stable-draft
```

## Vault Structure

A typical initialized workspace looks like this:

```text
10-raw/
  business_fact/
  industry_practice/
  team_history/
  feedback/

20-wiki/
  sources/
  entities/
  concepts/
  synthesis/
  conflicts/
  prd-patterns/
  index.md
  log.md

index.sqlite3
```

## Source Types and Boundaries

Supported `source_type` values:

- `business_fact`
- `industry_practice`
- `team_history`
- `feedback`

Behavior rules:

- `business_fact` may become stable business knowledge when evidence is strong
- `industry_practice` may become patterns or synthesis, but not customer truth
- `team_history` defaults to `draft`
- `feedback` defaults to `draft`
- conflicts never overwrite older knowledge; they go into `20-wiki/conflicts/`

## Design Intent

This repository prefers explicit state transitions over opaque ingestion.

Key design choices:

- preview before write
- deterministic archive application
- persistent raw source capture
- local retrieval over archived markdown
- configurable LLM usage, but usable fallback behavior without it

The result is closer to a small knowledge compiler than a chat wrapper around files.

## Who This Is For

- developers building agent-oriented knowledge workflows
- teams that need local, inspectable, versionable knowledge artifacts
- users who want a stricter alternative to direct document chat
- individuals maintaining a structured personal wiki knowledge base
