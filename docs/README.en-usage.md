# LLM Wiki Generator Usage Guide

[Back to README](../README.md) | [Docs Index](index.md) | [Chinese Overview](README.zh-home.md)

LLM Wiki Generator is friendly to any AI agent, any team workflow, and standalone CLI usage. It can be used as a skill or run directly as a Python CLI. Its goal is not just to “chat with files,” but to convert incoming material into structured wiki knowledge first, then retrieve and answer from that knowledge base in a controlled way.

This draft is written as an operational guide for people who want to ingest files, preview archive updates, write wiki pages, and query the resulting knowledge base.

## 1. What It Does

The project provides five core capabilities:

- Markdown conversion with `convert`
- archive preview with `show-updates`
- archive write with `apply`
- local indexing with `index`
- question answering with `answer`

Supported input formats:

- `PDF`
- `DOCX`
- `PPTX`
- `XLSX`
- `TXT`

## 2. Installation and Setup

### Install as a skill

If your host environment exposes an `npx install skill` style workflow, it is reasonable to install this project through that entrypoint first.

Example:

```bash
npx install skill llm-wiki-generator
```

Recommended post-install behavior:

1. verify that `Python 3` is installed
2. verify that `pip` is available
3. verify that the packages from `requirements.txt` are available
4. verify that `.env` exists and that core configuration values are present

If the environment is not ready, the skill should report what is missing, for example:

- `Python 3 is not installed`
- `pip is not available`
- `Missing Python packages: openai, pydantic, python-dotenv, pyyaml, rich, typer`
- `Optional packages missing for extended document support: pytest, python-docx, python-pptx, openpyxl, reportlab`

Once the user approves, the installer can install all missing dependencies before the skill is used.

Note: this is the recommended installation experience for a skill wrapper. In the current repository, the concrete assets already available are `requirements.txt` and `.env.example`.

### Install dependencies manually

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Typical configuration:

```env
LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible
LLM_BASE_URL=
LLM_API_KEY=
LLM_MODEL=
LLM_TIMEOUT=60
WIKI_ROOT=runtime/vault
WIKI_INDEX_DB=runtime/index.sqlite3
WIKI_SCOPE=stable
```

Notes:

- `WIKI_ROOT` is where the wiki vault is written
- `WIKI_INDEX_DB` is the local SQLite index file
- `WIKI_SCOPE` controls the default retrieval scope for `answer`
- if `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL` are not fully configured, the tool falls back to deterministic behavior

## 3. Initialize the Vault

Before archiving anything, first check whether the workspace has already been initialized:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py bootstrap-status --as-json
```

If initialization is missing, the recommended flow is:

1. ask whether the user wants to initialize now
2. ask where the wiki vault should be created
3. repeat the chosen path for confirmation
4. initialize the vault and persist the location into `.env`
5. immediately ask whether the user wants to provide the first document now

The corresponding initialization command is:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py bootstrap-init path/to/wiki-vault
```

It will:

- write `WIKI_ROOT`
- write `WIKI_INDEX_DB` next to the wiki root
- create the full vault structure

If the desired path is already configured in `.env`, you can still use the original initializer directly.

Before archiving anything, initialize the workspace:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py init
```

Expected structure:

```text
10-raw/
  business_fact/
  industry_practice/
  team_history/
  feedback/
20-wiki/
  sources/
  entities/
  concepts/
  synthesis/
  conflicts/
  prd-patterns/
  index.md
  log.md
```

Meaning:

- `10-raw/` stores copied source files
- `20-wiki/` stores structured Markdown knowledge pages
- `index.md` acts as a wiki entry page
- `log.md` records archive events

## 4. Command Reference

### `convert`

Convert a source file into Markdown without archiving it.

```bash
python scripts/cli.py convert path/to/file.pdf
```

Useful when you want to:

- inspect the raw conversion result
- validate that the source document can be parsed cleanly
- debug ingestion quality before archive preview

### `show-updates`

Preview archive output without writing any wiki pages.

```bash
python scripts/cli.py show-updates path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

This returns an `ArchivePreview` describing:

- which pages would be created or updated
- page type
- status such as `stable`, `draft`, or `conflict`
- confidence level
- evidence snippets
- archive rationale

This is the review step in the workflow.

### `apply`

Write the previewed archive result into the wiki.

```bash
python scripts/cli.py apply path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

What it does:

1. copies the original file into `10-raw/<source_type>/`
2. writes structured pages into `20-wiki/`
3. merges metadata if a target page already exists
4. appends new content as an update block on existing pages
5. updates `20-wiki/index.md`
6. appends an entry to `20-wiki/log.md`

In other words, `apply` is the actual archive step.

### `index`

Build the local retrieval index:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py index
```

This scans Markdown files under `20-wiki/` and writes them into a SQLite + FTS index used by `answer`.

### `answer`

Retrieve from the wiki and answer a question:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py answer "What business constraints are currently known?"
```

By default it searches `stable` knowledge only. You can widen the scope:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py answer "What design ideas were mentioned in team history?" --scope stable-draft
```

Supported `scope` values:

- `stable`
- `stable-draft`
- `all`

## 5. Choosing `source_type`

### `business_fact`

Use for:

- business rules
- customer constraints
- confirmed facts

Behavior:

- may become stable knowledge when evidence is strong enough

### `industry_practice`

Use for:

- market references
- general methods
- best practices

Behavior:

- better suited for `source`, `synthesis`, or `prd_pattern`
- should not be treated as customer truth

### `team_history`

Use for:

- historical design notes
- decision evolution
- past solution records

Behavior:

- defaults to `draft`

### `feedback`

Use for:

- user feedback
- internal comments
- interview notes

Behavior:

- defaults to `draft`

## 6. End-to-End Example

Assume you have a historical team document at `docs/team-retro.docx`:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py init
python scripts/cli.py show-updates docs/team-retro.docx --source-type team_history
python scripts/cli.py apply docs/team-retro.docx --source-type team_history
python scripts/cli.py index
python scripts/cli.py answer "What architecture ideas kept recurring over time?" --scope stable-draft
```

Recommended habit:

- always run `show-updates` before `apply`
- rebuild the index after a batch of archive operations
- use `stable-draft` when historical or exploratory material matters
- after first-time initialization, decide immediately whether to ingest the first document so the onboarding flow can continue without interruption

## 7. Model Mode vs Fallback Mode

When an OpenAI-compatible model is configured:

- archive preview is more intelligent
- answers are more natural and synthesis-oriented

When no model is configured:

- `show-updates` still returns a deterministic preview
- `answer` falls back to an extractive response style

That means the project remains usable even in no-model mode.

## 8. Mental Model

The recommended way to think about the workflow is:

1. `init` prepares the vault
2. `show-updates` reviews proposed knowledge changes
3. `apply` archives the approved changes
4. `index` prepares retrieval
5. `answer` consumes the archived knowledge

The key distinction is simple:

- `convert` extracts
- `show-updates` reviews
- `apply` archives
- `index` prepares retrieval
- `answer` uses the knowledge base
