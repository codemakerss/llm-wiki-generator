description: Build or query a standalone Obsidian-compatible LLM Wiki from PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT, and Markdown sources. Use when you need to convert files to Markdown, preview archive updates, write structured wiki pages, index the stable knowledge base, or answer questions from the wiki without depending on BA-Agent code.

# LLM Wiki Generator

## Overview

Use this skill when you want a fully standalone LLM Wiki workflow:

- convert common files into Markdown with bundled document parsers
- archive source documents using the host model in Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode
- optionally preview what knowledge updates would be archived
- build a local searchable index
- answer questions from stable or draft wiki knowledge

This skill does not depend on BA-Agent code, does not use `WikiUpdatePlan`, and does not require an approval step. By default, use the current host model to generate `ArchivePreview` JSON, then use the CLI only for deterministic conversion, validation, writing, indexing, and retrieval. Standalone CLI mode can still use an OpenAI-compatible API if configured.

## Initialization Guard

Before doing any archive, indexing, or answer work, first check whether the wiki has already been initialized.

Use:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py bootstrap-status --as-json
```

Behavior:

- if `initialized=true`, continue with the normal workflow
- if `initialized=false`, do not continue directly into archive or answer steps
- instead, start a short onboarding dialogue with the user

When initialization is missing, ask in this order:

1. whether they want to initialize now
2. which filesystem path should hold the wiki vault
3. repeat the chosen path back to them and ask for confirmation

After the user confirms, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py bootstrap-init /absolute/or/relative/wiki-root
```

This will:

- write `WIKI_ROOT` into `.env`
- write `WIKI_INDEX_DB` into `.env` as a sibling to the chosen wiki root
- create the full vault structure under the confirmed path

Immediately after a successful initialization, ask the user whether they want to provide their first document now.

If the user declines initialization, stop the archive/query flow and explain that initialization is required before the skill can continue.

## Supported Inputs

The archive pipeline accepts these file types:

- `PDF`
- `DOCX`
- `PPTX`
- `XLSX`
- `TXT`
- `MD`
- `Markdown`

Markdown files are read as-is from `.md` and `.markdown` files. MarkItDown is not integrated in the current implementation.

## Workflow

### 1. Initialize a standalone vault

Run:

```bash
cp skill/llm-wiki-generator/.env.example skill/llm-wiki-generator/.env
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py init
```

This creates an Obsidian-compatible structure under `WIKI_ROOT`:

- `10-raw/`
- `20-wiki/sources/`
- `20-wiki/entities/`
- `20-wiki/concepts/`
- `20-wiki/synthesis/`
- `20-wiki/conflicts/`
- `20-wiki/prd-patterns/`
- `20-wiki/index.md`
- `20-wiki/log.md`

### 2. Convert a file to Markdown

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py convert path/to/file.pdf
```

Use this when you only want to inspect the Markdown extraction result.

For host-model archiving, use structured JSON:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py convert path/to/file.pdf --as-json
```

### 3. Archive with the host model by default

Use this default flow when the skill is running inside Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode:

1. run `convert --as-json` on the source file
2. use the current host model to produce strict `ArchivePreview` JSON from the converted Markdown
3. write that JSON to a temporary preview file
4. run `apply-preview` to validate, write, and index

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py apply-preview path/to/file.docx --preview-file /tmp/archive-preview.json
```

This command validates the host-generated preview, enforces source-boundary rules, writes raw/wiki files, and rebuilds the index by default so the archived knowledge is ready for recall.

Use `--no-index` only when batching many files and planning to run `index` once at the end.

### 4. Standalone API archive mode

If the user explicitly wants to run the Python CLI outside a host agent, or has configured an OpenAI-compatible API in `.env`, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py archive path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

Standalone archive requires `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and `LLM_MODEL`.

### 5. Optional preview or manual apply

If the user explicitly wants to inspect the LLM output without writing files, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py show-updates path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

If the user already wants to write but not rebuild the index, run:


```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py apply path/to/file.docx --source-type team_history
```

The writer is deterministic. It:

- copies the raw source into `10-raw/<source_type>/`
- writes or updates wiki pages under `20-wiki/`
- updates `20-wiki/index.md`
- appends to `20-wiki/log.md`

### 6. Build the local index manually

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py index
```

This builds a local SQLite index for wiki retrieval. It is already run by `apply-preview` and `archive` unless `--no-index` is used.

### 7. Recall from the wiki with the host model

Use this default flow for knowledge recall inside Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode:

1. run deterministic search:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py search "当前已知的业务约束是什么？" --scope stable-draft --as-json
```

2. use the current host model to answer from only the returned documents
3. cite page titles from the search results

Default scope is `stable`; use `stable-draft` when team history or exploratory notes should be included.

### 8. Standalone CLI answer mode

Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py answer "当前已知的业务约束是什么？"
```

Default scope is `stable`. You can override it:

```bash
.venv/bin/python skill/llm-wiki-generator/scripts/cli.py answer "团队历史里提到的设计思路有哪些？" --scope stable-draft
```

## Source Boundary Rules

- `business_fact`: can become factual business knowledge if evidence is strong and there is no conflict
- `industry_practice`: can become `source`, `synthesis`, or `prd_pattern`; it must not become customer fact
- `team_history`: can become `source`, `concept`, `synthesis`, or `prd_pattern`; it always defaults to `draft`
- `feedback`: defaults to `draft`
- conflicts never overwrite older knowledge; they become `20-wiki/conflicts/`

## Environment

For host-model skill usage, `.env` only needs wiki paths:

- `WIKI_ROOT`
- `WIKI_INDEX_DB`
- `WIKI_SCOPE`

For standalone OpenAI-compatible CLI mode, also set:

- `LLM_PROVIDER`
- `LLM_BASE_URL`
- `LLM_API_KEY`
- `LLM_MODEL`

The LLM endpoint must support the OpenAI chat-completions format.
